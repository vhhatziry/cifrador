Hi, I hope you're great
I think it's time we took a break
So I can grow emotionally
That's what he said to me

Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love and I'm the one they call for a third-wheeling
Probably should've guessed he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in

Me? No, yeah, I'm good
Just thought that he
Eventually would cave and reach out
But no siree, he discovered self-control
(He discovered it this week) this week (oh-ah)

Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love and I'm the one they call for a third-wheeling
Probably should've guessed he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in
(Believe in, oh-oh-oh-woah-oh-oh-woah)

That boy is corrupt (ah)
Could you raise him to love me, maybe?
He sure fucked me up (ah-ah)
And, yes, I'm talkin' 'bout your baby
That boy is corrupt (ah)
Get PTSD on the daily
He sure fucked me up
And, yes, I'm talkin' 'bout your baby

Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love and I'm the one they call for a third-wheeling
Probably should've guessed he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in
